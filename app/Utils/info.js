// I first started coding as a sophomore in high school. I started with Visual Basic and Java eventually learning JavaScript in my free time. I attended The City College of New York as a Biology major and graduated with a degree in the science field. Even as a learned and made my way up the medical field, I made sure to make time for coding. It became more of a stress relief for me at that point.
//
// After graduating, I became an EMT and pursued that as a career. Of course I was never able to get rid of the habit of sitting in front of a screen coding and reading up on new technologies and frameworks. I soon realized that I was enjoying my hobby more than my actual career and the passion I had for coding became the prevalent part of my life. I decided to switch careers and pursue software engineering. I start learning on my own before attending a full-time bootcamp to further learn and enhance my knowledge.
//
// I have since worked on a few freelance projects while adding modern JavaScript technologies (React, Angular, Node, Express, Postgres) to my toolbelt. I currently work part time for a mobile start up company. I am most interested in front-end roles, but open to full-stack opportunities as well. If you think I would be a good fit for your team, please feel free to reach out!
